  With TLSU you can easily add TLS to your Umbrel apps.


  https://umbrel.tlsu.site


  All your traffic stays local and secure, just a bit of DNS sorcery.


  Apps are accessible via a subdomain of tlsu.site (e.g. umbrel.tlsu.site and tlsu.tlsu.site) and secured with a valid TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt.
